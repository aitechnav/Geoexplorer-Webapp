### Geoexplorer-webapp


# Overview: 
```
GeoExplorer AI is an interactive mapping application that goes beyond traditional maps by integrating AI-generated information.
At its core, it combines the familiar Google Maps interface with Google's Gemini AI to generate rich, contextual information about
any location you click on.

The application is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—no frameworks or complex dependencies. This makes it an
ideal example project for learning how to integrate different APIs and services.
